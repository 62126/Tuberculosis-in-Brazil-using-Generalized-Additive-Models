# Tuberculosis-in-Brazil-using-Generalized-Additive-Models-

Data was provided about Tuberculosis in Brazil, this included Brazilâ€™s literacy rate, density, poverty rate, level of sanitation, unemployment, etc. Data was first wrangled to suit our needs; Generalized Additive Models were then built to give meaning to the data. As this was a collaborative work with only 4 members, the team decided to take a waterfall approach.
